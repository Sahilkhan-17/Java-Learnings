##  **variables** 
  There are three types of variables in java: local, instance and static.


### static variable
  You can create a single copy of the static variable and share it among all the instances of the class. Memory allocation for static variables happens only once     when the class is loaded in the memory.

>   The final keyword is used to declare a constant variable in Java, meaning its value cannot be changed once initialized.

>   In Java, an uninitialized int variable has a default value of 0.


##  **data-types**
  There are two types of data types in Java:

` Primitive data types` : The primitive data types include` boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float ` and ` double.`

` Non-primitive data types ` : The non-primitive data types include` Classes, Interfaces, Arrays, Enums and Collections.`


##  **operators**
Operator in Java is a symbol that is used to perform operations. For example: ` +, -, *, / etc. `

There are many types of operators in Java which are given below:

` Unary, Arithmetic, Shift, Relational, Bitwise, Logical, Ternary and Assignment Operator. `
